# DynamicRoundRobinModel

A few weeks ago in my operating systems class we learned about different
process handling methods,like FIFO, FCFS, and so forth.
Eventually we came to the subject of RoundRobin process handling. It was 
very intriguging to me, so much so that I approached my professor to talk
more about it. He said that Round Robin is great, and that it become even
more effective with a dynamic quantum time slice. So I decided to program
a model of this to demonstrate the speed advantages of dynamic quantum, 
and potentially create an actual process scheduler. 

Thanks!
